# Second Version Design Notes

The first version has some annoyances and extra goodies that are not necessary to the main funtionality. Also, there was
a bit of "overthinking" by trying to accommodate more things than buttons.

Also, the major bottleneck in terms of performance/feedback is from the larger OLED screen.

## Design Goals

1. Clearly defined "modes" based on time of day
2. Simplified OLED (small screen)
3. Dump EXIT button
4. Color-code LED to what action it's set for
  - TBD colors _react_ to MQTT messages?
5. Strip keeps on stripping

### Random Additions

- change "mode" based on events
- color-code buttons based on mode/action/events
